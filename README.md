# MScThesis

This GitHub repository contains all R-code for the MSc Thesis in Statistics and Data Science of Lana Broer, completed ..., at Leiden University; supervised by dr. Alessio Crippa (Karolinska Insitutet) and dr. Mirko Signorelli (Leiden University).
The data used in this project is part of the ProBio trial (Karolinska Insititutet, Sweden), an international, multi-center, randomized controlled phase 3 platform trial, which aims to investigate novel treatments for metastatic prostate cancer.

The repository contains ... files:
* data_management: loads all relevant dataframes and performs initial preparation of the most used dataframes;
* RQ1_PSA_descriptives: produces all descriptive statistics (including plots) to answer the first research question, which focuses on exploring the PSA trajectories;
* RQ1_exploration_trajectories: explores the different types of PSA trajectories for patients in the ProBio trial;
* RQ2_explanatory_model_JMbayes: fits a number of joint models to explore the relationship between repeated measurements of Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) and the survival outcome No-Longer Clinical Benefit (NLCB);
* RQ2_explanatory_model_timedependentCox: fits a time-dependent Cox model to explore the relationship between PSA and NLCB.
